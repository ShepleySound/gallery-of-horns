# Horned Beasts - First React Project

The project demonstrates a basic use of React and React-Bootstrap, using curriculum and assets from Code Fellows.  
The page allows the user to "like" a series of images. Images can be filtered by internal keywords using a search bar and by "number of horns" using a dropdown selector.
